- Compilers are computer programs that translate a program written in one language into a program written in another language.
- A compiler report any errors in the source program that it detects during the translation process.

Compilers  differ from one another on the basis of the machine code they generate :
- **Assembly or another source format**
	-  a low-level symbolic code in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
	- assembly languages are designed to be readable by humans
	- example MOV AL, 61h
- **Relocatable binary**
	- Relative address
	- A linkage step is required
- **Absolute binary**
	- Absolute address
	- Can be executed directly
	- in this its a binary file which is ready to execute
