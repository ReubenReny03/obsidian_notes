**Distributed Systems:** Google uses a distributed system architecture, spreading tasks across multiple servers rather than relying on a single, centralized server. This approach improves reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

**Data Centers:** Google operates numerous data centers worldwide. These centers house a large number of servers, networking equipment, and storage devices. The distributed nature of these data centers allows for redundancy and efficient load balancing.

**Google File System (GFS):** Google utilizes a distributed file system called GFS, later succeeded by Colossus. These file systems provide a scalable and reliable way to store and access vast amounts of data across multiple servers.

**TensorFlow:** For machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, Google uses TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library. TensorFlow supports distributed computing, enabling the training of complex models across multiple machines.
