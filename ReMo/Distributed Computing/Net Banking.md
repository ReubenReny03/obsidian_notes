We can take the example of SBI and if they only have 1 server and if it fails then no one can access the banks at all hence they have multiple servers

each server has the same data and how is this maintained, using the messages it shares the data which is updated in either one keeping both of them up to date

and the users can connect to any of the server and in case one goes down they are redirected to another server
